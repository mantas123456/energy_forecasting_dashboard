# 🔋 Real-Time Energy Forecasting & Carbon Impact Dashboard

This project simulates, forecasts, and visualizes building energy consumption while estimating the carbon footprint in a modular, production-ready pipeline. It’s designed for energy efficiency analytics, carbon reduction strategies, and professional data science portfolio demonstration.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation & Visualization

**Objective:** Simulate realistic hourly energy consumption patterns across Residential, Commercial, and Mixed sectors and visualize them alongside carbon emissions.

### 📌 Deliverables
- **Synthetic Dataset Generator**:
  - Residential, Commercial, and Mixed-use building profiles
  - 365-day, hourly resolution
  - Diurnal cycles, weekly trends, temperature effects, holidays
- **Carbon Emissions Estimation**:
  - Based on Malta’s national emission factor: `396 gCO₂e/kWh`
- **Modular File Loader**:
  - Robust loading of datasets from any location within project
- **Visualization Notebook**:
  - Daily average plots for energy use and carbon impact
  - 7-day rolling averages for trend clarity

## 🧭 Phase 2 Preview: Forecasting

We will now build time-series forecasting models to predict future energy consumption and carbon output:

- 📈 Prophet for trend/seasonality modeling
- ⚡ XGBoost for feature-rich regression
- 🔁 Linear Regression baseline
- 📊 Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
- 🌱 Carbon estimation from forecasts

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To generate synthetic data:

```bash
python scripts/synthetic_data_generator.py
```

To visualize it:

```bash
Open notebooks/01_visualize_synthetic_data.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code
```
